Hello, and thank you for reading this README file.

The file hierarchical structure will be as follows:
    Each directory will contain the code for the specific organ in question.
    Example:
        Breast : will contain the source code necessary to construct the presemantic and postsemantic model. As well as any model(s) contructed for            classification  
    
    interface : will contain the code for constructing the driver for the program. The code that interfaces with the models and the user goes here.
